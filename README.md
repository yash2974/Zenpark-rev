Zenpark - Smart Parking Management System
Zenpark is a cutting-edge parking management solution that utilizes AI to streamline parking lot operations. Using advanced technologies like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for vehicle number plate recognition, Zenpark provides real-time parking management, ensuring a seamless experience for both parking lot owners and vehicle owners.

Features
AI-Powered Number Plate Recognition: Automatically reads and matches vehicle number plates using YOLO and OCR.

Real-Time Parking Management: Tracks vehicles entering and exiting the parking area.

Seamless Registration & Profile Management: Users can register and manage their profiles efficiently.

WebSocket Integration: Real-time data communication between frontend and backend.

Efficient Data Storage: Utilizes MongoDB for user data and MySQL for vehicle entry/exit logs.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React Native

Backend: FastAPI

AI: YOLO (Object Detection), OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

Database: MongoDB (for user profiles), MySQL (for entry/exit logs)

Real-Time Communication: WebSocket
